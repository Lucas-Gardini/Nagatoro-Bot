## This project ISN'T suitable for React development!

**I set this up to be used in the development of console applications!**

If you're looking for a React boilerplate, this project doesn't supply your needs.

## TypeScript Boilerplate by iLuiizUHD

This project was built to help new developers (or some more experienced developers) to get started easily and reliable in a new TypeScript project, providing a bunch of features that helps development and building for deploy!

### These are the features this repository provides:

- ESLint (AirBnb style)
- Prettier
- EditorConfig
- WebPack
- Complete `tsconfig.json` file

#### ESLint

✔ This project comes with ESLint fully set up, no time wasted setting up this.

#### Prettier

✔ Fully set up to quickly turn your code into a masterpiece.

`Quick note: If you're using VSCode, remeber installing both ESLint and Prettier extensions and setting up you VSCode to automatically fix the code when you save it`

#### WebPack

✔ Build your entire codebase into a single ES6 file, wich you can start by running `node dist/index.js`
